# Project-Workflow
Standard industry-level development workflow for placement-oriented software projects.
🚀 Placement Project – Standard Development Workflow
📌 Overview

This repository defines the structured Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) that our team will follow while building a placement-oriented project.

The objective is to ensure:

1-Clear and structured planning
2-Organized Git workflow
3-Collaborative development
4-Proper testing and validation
5-Clean and controlled deployment

This workflow allows us to move from idea to production in a professional and industry-aligned manner.

-📊 Workflow Diagram
-🧠 Development Lifecycle Phases

1️⃣ Idea & Planning

-Brainstorm potential project ideas
-Define a clear problem statement
-Identify target users
-Finalize the technology stack

2️⃣ Requirement Analysis

-Define MVP (Minimum Viable Product) features
-List future enhancements
-Prioritize tasks
-Freeze MVP scope

3️⃣ System Design

-High-Level Architecture design
-Database schema design
-API design and endpoint planning
-UI wireframe preparation

4️⃣ Project Setup

-Create GitHub repository
-Define branching strategy
-Setup folder structure
-Configure development environment

🔁 Development Cycle

-For every feature implementation:

-Create a GitHub Issue
-Create a feature branch from develop
-Implement the feature
-Commit changes with meaningful messages
-Raise a Pull Request
-Peer review and fix requested changes
-Merge into develop

🧪 Testing Strategy

Before deployment, the following testing steps are performed:

-Unit Testing
-API Testing
-UI/Manual Testing
-Bug fixing and validation loop

If bugs are found, the workflow cycles back to the development phase.

🚀 Deployment Strategy

-Only the main branch is deployed
-Deployment is performed after testing approval
-Environment variables and configuration are managed securely
-Post-deployment monitoring is conducted

🔄 Maintenance & Iteration

After deployment:

-Monitor performance and logs
-Fix production issues
-Optimize performance
-Add new features in iterative cycles

🎯 Objective of This Workflow

This workflow ensures:

-Structured execution
-Clear responsibility distribution
-Version control discipline
-Industry-standard development practice



👥 Team

(To be updated once project roles are finalized)

This process will be followed for all future placement-oriented projects developed by the team.
